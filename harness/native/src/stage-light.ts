/**
 * Light the harness's scene through the native host's `environment` slice,
 * read structurally. A native scene has no light until something applies
 * one, and an unlit scene draws every mesh that is not self-lit black. The
 * web examples add their own lights with their engine; here the host owns
 * rendering, so the harness asks it for a plain studio look: a soft gradient
 * sky, an ambient light and one key light from above and behind the viewer.
 *
 * The Service Framework owns no lighting contract. The members and the value shapes are
 * the Environment family's native contract (`applySky`, `applyAmbient`,
 * `applyKeyLight`: colours as `[r, g, b]` from 0 to 1, the key light's
 * direction the way the light travels), declared here as the three calls the
 * harness makes and nothing more.
